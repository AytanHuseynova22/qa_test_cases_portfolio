"Description:

"Environment:

2. Click “Get started”
3. Go to Sign In page.
4. Click Forgot Password.
5. Enter a valid registered email.
6. Click Send / Reset password."	
	
"Expected Result:

The system should send a password reset email with a code or link.

User should see a success confirmation message (e.g., ""We’ve sent you an email with reset instructions."")."	
	
"Actual Result:

An Error message appears at the top (without explanation).

No reset email is received."	
	
Severity: 🟠 Major (blocks users from resetting password, so they cannot recover access).
